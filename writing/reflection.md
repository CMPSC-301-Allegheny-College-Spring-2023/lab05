## Part 2. Writing About Ethics

Please write in clear and meaningful language.

1.  What type(s) of damage may happen to public medicine and /or public opinion from misinformation? What is an example from the article?

	TODO

2. What should be the role of academic groups that publish or push research to prevent misinformation?

	TODO

3. Researchers associated with misinformed papers tend to retract their names from these articles. This likely means that the researchers (and their organizations) no longer support the content of the article. After the damage was committed from Wakefield’s paper, can retracting one’s name from a paper (or retracting the paper itself) be enough to fix this damage? How could the damage be fixed, in your opinion?

	TODO

(Did you remember to leave your name at the top of this document?)
